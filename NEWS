Overview of changes in libqmi 1.28.0
----------------------------------------

 * Build now optionally depends on the libqrtr-glib v1.0.0 library, which is
   no longer maintained inside the libqmi sources. All the QRTR related methods
   implemented in the QmiDevice object in the libqmi-glib library are considered
   API/ABI stable.

 * The pkg-config file now exposes build features as variables, which allows
   other projects to detect them at configure time. E.g. to check whether the
   libqmi-glib library was built with QRTR support:
       qmi_qrtr_supported=$($PKG_CONFIG --variable=qmi_qrtr_supported qmi-glib)
       if test "x$qmi_qrtr_supported" = "x1"; then
         ....
       fi

 * The QmiDevice interfaces to work with the expected data format and the wwan
   interface name should now be considered to be specific to QMI devices exposed
   by the upstream 'qmi_wwan' kernel driver. If the device is exposed with a
   different driver (e.g. PCIe or QRTR) these methods will always fail.

 * The QmiDevice now supports configuring the 'pass_through' sysfs setting in
   the network interfaces exposed by the 'qmi_wwan' kernel driver, with a new
   'qmap-pass-through' expected data format type. In this mode, the network
   device will be managed by the rmnet kernel driver. A new method is also
   provided to check in runtime whether a given expected data format value is
   supported by the kernel or not.

 * The QmiDevice now includes methods to list, create and delete links on the
   network interface, that can be used to setup QMAP based multiplexing of
   different data streams, e.g. connected to different APNs. When using the
   'qmi_wwan' kernel driver, the link management logic depends on the configured
   expected data format:
     ** rmnet netlink operations will be used if 'qmap-pass-through' expected
        data format is configured.
     ** add_mux/del_mux operations will be used if 'raw-ip' expected data format
        is configured.
   When not using 'qmi_wwan', rmnet netlink operations are assumed.

 * New services:
   ** New 'SAR' (Specific Absorption Rate) service, with support for the "Set RF
      State" and "Get RF State" request/responses.

 * New request/response/indications:
   ** uim: implement "Refresh Register" request/response.

   ** wds: implement "Set LTE Attach PDN List" indication.
   ** wds: implement "Get LTE Attach Parameters" request/response.
   ** wds: renamed "Get Default Profile Num" to "Get Default Profile Number",
      and provided compat symbols to avoid breaking API.
   ** wds: renamed "Set Default Profile Num" to "Set Default Profile Number",
      and provided compat symbols to avoid breaking API.

 * New TLVs supported in existing messages:
   ** nas: added the "Rx Chain 2/3 Info" TLVs in "Get Tx Rx Info".
   ** nas: added the "LTE Info Timing Advance" TLV in "Get Cell Location Info".
   ** nas: added the "LTE Voice Domain", "CDMA Registration Zone ID", "GSM
      Routing Area Code", "WCDMA Routing Area Code" and "CDMA Resolved MCC"
      TLVs in "Get System Info".

 * libqmi-glib:
   ** Added support for 'embedded' and 'pcie' endpoint types.
   ** Added support for QMAPv5 data aggregation type.

 * qmicli:
   ** When built with QRTR support, the '--device' option now allows QRTR URIs
      (e.g. 'qrtr://0').
   ** New '--link-list', '--link-add', '--link-delete' and '--link-delete-all'
      commands.
   ** New '--uim-monitor-refresh-file' command.
   ** New '--uim-monitor-refresh-all' command.
   ** New '--wds-bind-data-port' command.

      commands.
   ** Updated the '--wds-start-network' command with a timeout of 180s.
   ** Updated the '--wds-stop-network' command with a timeout of 120s.
   ** Updated the '--dms-set-firmware-preference' command to use a key-value
      pair based input instead of predefined fields.

 * collections:
   ** basic: added UIM event registration commands.
   ** basic: added UIM slot management commands.
   ** basic: added UIM refresh related commands.
   ** basic: added WDS bind data port commands.
   ** basic: added WDS initial LTE bearer management commands.
   ** basic: added NAS PLMN name commands.

The following features which were backported to 1.26.x releases are also present
in libqmi 1.28.0:

 * build:
   ** Avoid including qmi-version.h in dist, as its contents depend on the given
      configure options.

 * libqmi-glib:
   ** 5G support in the NAS signal info operations.
   ** BCD encoded strings should be read as arrays instead of NUL-terminated
      strings.

 * qmicli:
   ** nas: report EcIo, RSRP and phase also in 5GNR.


Overview of changes in libqmi 1.26.0
----------------------------------------

 * Build now requires GLib/GObject/GIO 2.48.

 * Build updated with several improvements:
   ** The build has been updated to use by default all warnings enabled by
      AX_COMPILER_FLAGS(), and therefore when building the release from a git
      checkout, autoconf-archive >= 2017.03.21 is now required. This new build
      dependency isn't required when building from the release tarball.
   ** Also when building from a git checkout, beware because by default
      --enable-compile-warnings=error is enabled, which implies -Werror. If
      you'd like to build from git and avoid -Werror, you should explicitly use
      --enable-compile-warnings=yes (to keep the warnings but without being
      errors), --enable-compile-warnings=no (to disable all the extra warnings
      enabled by default) or --disable-Werror (to unconditionally make all
      compiler warnings non-fatal).

 * Added new message collections support, so that users can select which
   messages to include in the built library during configure with the
   --enable-collection option. Three predefined sets are given:
   ** minimal: the bare minimum messages required to control connectivity.
   ** basic: all messages and indications that ModemManager requires.
   ** full: all supported messages and indications.
   Users can install custom collections under data/ and reference them in
   the same way as the predefined sets. E.g. installing a new
   data/qmi-collection-custom.json set can be enabled during configure with
   --enable-collection=custom.

 * Added new GObject Introspection support in the library, that can be
   explicitly requested during configure with --enable-introspection=yes.
   With the new introspection support, the libqmi-glib library can now be
   used directly from e.g. python programs, as in the example included with
   the release.

 * Implemented new QRTR backend support, disabled by default. This new backend
   allows to perform QMI operations on systems with the Qualcomm IPC router
   protocol available (since Linux 4.7). Users can build the QRTR backend
   support with --enable-qrtr, and will require the corresponding kernel
   headers. When this backend is enabled, a new libqrtr-glib library is built
   and installed along with libqmi-glib. The API of this libqrtr-glib library,
   and the QRTR-specific APIs in libqmi-glib (e.g. qmi_device_new_from_node())
   must not be considered stable yet, they may change in future versions of the
   project, even in 1.26.x updates. The libqmi-glib headers include a new
   QMI_QRTR_SUPPORTED symbol that specifies whether the QRTR backed has been
   enabled (if set to 1) or not (if set to 0).

 * Added 5GNR radio access technology support, with new enum values in both the
   DMS and NAS services.

 * New services:
   ** New 'GMS' (Telit General Modem Service) service, for now just implementing
      basic test get/set value commands.
   ** New 'DSD' (Data System Determination) service, implementing methods to get
      and set default bearer APN settings.

 * New request/response/indications:
   ** dms: implement "Get MAC Address" request/response.
   ** dms: renamed "Dell Get Firmware Version" to "Foxconn Get Firmware Version"
      as the command applies not only to the Dell-branded variant, but also to
      the generic Foxconn-branded models. The old APIs are kept available but
      flagged as deprecated.
   ** loc: implement "Set NMEA Types" request/response.
   ** loc: implement "Get NMEA Types" request/response.
   ** uim: implement "Switch Slot" request/response.
   ** uim: implement "Get Slot Status" request/response.
   ** uim: implement "Slot Status" indication.
   ** voice: implement "Indication Register" request/response.
   ** voice: implement "Originate USSD" request/response.
   ** voice: implement "Answer USSD" request/response.
   ** voice: implement "Cancel USSD" request/response.
   ** voice: implement "Release USSD" request/response.
   ** voice: implement "USSD" indication.
   ** voice: implement "Originate USSD No Wait" request/response.
   ** voice: implement "Originate USSD No Wait" indication.

 * New TLVs supported in existing messages:
   ** nas: added 'Extended List' and 'Bandwidth List' in "Get RF Band
      Information".
   ** wda: added 'Endpoint Info' in "Get Data Format".

 * libqmi-glib:
   ** Added g_autoptr() support to all public types.
   ** The qmi_message_get_version_introduced_full() method is now deprecated
      and should no longer be used in newly written code. This method will
      always return FALSE as the details of which protocol version introduced
      the message are no longer available.

 * qmi-proxy:
   ** Updated to keep track of QMI clients that have not been explicitly
      released, so that qmicli --client-cid=[CID] and --client-no-release-cid
      operations can handle indications properly.

The following features which were backported to 1.24.x releases are also present
in libqmi 1.26.0:

 * libqmi-glib:
   ** The logic behind QMI_DEVICE_OPEN_FLAGS_VERSION_INFO has been updated, and
      from now on it will only make sure the version info of the device is
      loaded when it's opened. The library will no longer prevent a given
      message from being sent to the module based on the version information
      kept in the message database.
   ** Updated string reading logic to make sure that all strings are valid
      UTF-8, and also automatically attempt parsing as GSM7 or UCS2 if the
      initial UTF-8 validation fails.
   *+ Renamed TLV 0x15 in the "WDA Get Data Format" message, and added new
      compat methods for the old name.
   ** Fixed the format of the NITZ information TLV, and added new compat
      methods for the old name.
   ** Fixed the format of the Home Network 3GPP2 TLV, and added new compat
      methods for the old name.
   ** Added new WDS verbose call end reasons in the IPv6, PPP, 3GPP, CM and
      Internal groups.
   ** Updated to detect QMI control ports exposed as 'smdpkt' or 'rpmsg' virtual
      devices.


Overview of changes in libqmi 1.24.0
----------------------------------------

 * New services:
   ** New 'GAS' (Telit General Application Service) service, which allows
      switching between stored firmware images in Telit devices.

 * New request/responses/indications:
   ** uim: implement 'Change Provisioning Session' request/response.
   ** nas: implement Sierra-specific 'Swi Get Status' request/response.

 * New TLVs supported in existing messages:
   * nas: added 'Usage Preference' in "Get/Set System Selection Preference".
   * nas: added 'Network Name Source' in "Get Serving System" and "Get Home
     Network".
   * nas: added 'LTE Cell Access Status' in "Get System Info".
   * nas: added 'IMS Voice Support' in "Get System Info".
   * nas: added 'LTE eMBMS Coverage Info Trace ID' in "Get System Info".
   * nas: added 'Network Selection Registration Restriction' in "Get System
     Info".
   * nas: added 'LTE Registration Domain' in "Get System Info".
   * nas: added 'Disabled Modes' in "Get System Selection Preference".
   * nas: added 'Network Selection Registration Restriction" in "Get/Set System
     Selection Preference".
   * nas: added 'Voice Domain Preference' in "Get/Set System Selection
     Preference".
   * nas: added 'Network Scan Result' in "Network Scan".
   * dms: added 'Imei Software Version" in "Get IDs".

 * libqmi:
   ** New qmi_device_command_abortable() async method is used with requests that
      are abortable (both "WDS Start Network" and "NAS Network Scan" so far),
      so that the method waits for either the request succeed or for the abort
      operation to finish. This new method solves races when a successful
      response to the message is received after the abort has been requested
      (e.g. if receiving a successful response to WDS Start Network after the
      abort request has been sent, the async operation succeeds and the abort
      will be ignored). The user must understand that aborting a command
      initiated with qmi_device_command_abortable() doesn't mean it will fail
      as aborted, the command may actually succeed. Although this is a new
      command in the interface, both qmi_client_wds_start_network() and
      qmi_client_nas_network_scan() will use it internally and transparently for
      the user.
   ** New qmi_message_new_from_data() and qmi_message_get_data() methods to work
      with QMI messages that don't have QMUX headers.
   ** New support for symlinks in /dev/cdc-wdm ports.
   ** QMI over MBIM transaction timeout logic was simplified in order to rely on
      the QMI transaction timeout instead of the MBIM one.
   ** Reworked internals to have different 'QMI endpoint' implementations, in
      order to easily integrate new transports like QRTR.
   ** Added definition of LTE bands 164 through 168 in NAS service.
   ** Added retry support when opening the QmiDevice with the SYNC flag only
      (without the VERSION_CHECK).

 * qmi-proxy:
   ** New '--empty-timeout=[SECS}' option.

 * qmicli:
   ** New '--uim-change-provisioning-session' command.
   ** New '--gas-dms-get-firmware-list' command.
   ** New '--gas-dms-get-active-firmware' command.
   ** New '--gas-dms-set-active-firmware' command.
   ** New '--gas-noop' command.
   ** New '--nas-swi-get-status' command.
   ** Added support to request auto/manual network attachment when using
      '--nas-set-system-selection-preference'.

 * qmi-firmware-update:
   ** Added support for upgrading the Sierra Wireless EM7565 module with the new
      Sahara/Firehose protocol.

 * Several other minor improvements and fixes.

The following features which were backported to 1.22.x releases are also present
in libqmi 1.24.0:

 * Build updated to explicitly define max allowed GLib version.

 * New request/responses/indications:
   ** uim: new "Register Events" request/response.

   ** New '--dms-dell-change-device-mode' command.
   ** New '--dms-dell-get-firmware-version' command.


Overview of changes in libqmi 1.22.0

   configure.

 * New services:
   ** New 'QoS' (Quality of Service) service, with some minimal initial
      implementation to support flow/network status querying. Additionally,
      some Sierra-specific commands are also implemented that allow querying
      per-bearer statistics (e.g. if multiple dedicated and default LTE bearers
      are used).

 * New request/responses/indications:
   ** loc: new "Register Events" request/response.
   ** loc: new "NMEA" indication.
   ** loc: new "Engine State" indication.
   ** loc: new "Fix Recurrence Type" indication.
   ** loc: new "GNSS Sv Info" indication.

   ** wds: added 'WDS APN Disabled Flag' TLV in "Create Profile", "Modify
      Profile" and "Get Profile Settings".
   ** wds: added 'WDS Roaming Disallowed Flag' TLV in "Create Profile",
      "Modify Profile" and "Get Profile Settings".

 * libqmi:
   ** Assume TLVs < 0x10 are mandatory by default.
   ** Fixed some missing QmiProtocolErrors and updated some existing ones.
   ** Implemented support to allow enabling QMI indications when in MBIM mode.
   ** Addded missing QmiNasBandPreference and QmiDmsLteBandCapability flags.
   ** Deprecate QMI_CORE_ERROR_TLV_EMPTY, as empty TLVs are allowed by the
      protocol and totally valid e.g. in 0-sized string-type TLVs.
   ** Moved all deprecated APIs to 'qmi-compat.h' header.

 * qmicli:
   ** New '--loc-get-position-report' command.
   ** New '--loc-get-gnss-sv-info' command.

   ** Fixed '--uim-set-pin-protection', '--uim-verify-pin", "--uim-unblock-pin",
      and '--uim-change-pin', so that a dummy application identifier is always
      used.
   ** Updated so that all commands work even through QMI over MBIM, even if
      indications are required to complete the command (e.g. most PDC and LOC
      commands).

 * qmi-network:
   ** Avoid creating invalid --wds-start-network when APN is not set.

 * Several other minor improvements and fixes.

The following features which were backported to 1.20.x releases are also present
in libqmi 1.22.0:

      whether the underlying QmiDevice is usable or not.
   ** Defined additional LTE bands.

 * qmicli:
   ** New '--wds-set-ip-family' command.
   ** New '--wds-get-channel-rates' command.

   ** Support USB3->USB2 mode changes during upgrade.


Overview of changes in libqmi 1.18.0
----------------------------------------

The full list of new features include:

 * libqmi:
   ** Implemented support for vendor-specific commands through a new
      qmi_device_command_full() operation and a new QmiMessageContext type. The
      original qmi_device_command() is flagged as deprecated.
   ** New 'QMI_DEVICE_OPEN_FLAGS_AUTO' flag in qmi_device_open() which allows
      automatic detection of the underlying protocol in a cdc-wdm device (either
      QMI or MBIM) and transparently uses it based on that.
   ** New qmi_device_close_async() operation, which allows closing a QmiDevice
      asynchronously (especially important when closing devices running QMI over
      MBIM, as this operation requires MBIM protocol cleanups). The original
      qmi_device_close() is flagged as deprecated.
   ** Fixed QmiWmsCdmaCauseCode enum names, and provided a compatibility layer
      keeping the old names (flagged as deprecated) to avoid breaking API.

 * New services:
   ** pdc: new "PDC" (persistent device configuration) service, which among
      other things, allows configuring the HP lt4120.

   ** wda: updated "Set Data Format" request to allow specifying endpoint type
      and interface number.

 * qmi-firmware-update:
   ** This is a completely new tool that allows upgrading firmware in (at least)
      Sierra Wireless devices with MDM9200, MDM9x15 or MDM9x30 chipsets. Run the
      tool with --help and --help-examples to get more information on how to use
      it.

 * qmicli:
   ** The CLI no longer requires the '--device-open-mbim' explicit option when
      opening QMI capable MBIM devices, the automatic detection of QMI over MBIM

   ** By default the QmiDevice will be closed before exiting, e.g. so that the
      MBIM session is also closed.

 * docs:
   ** Updated the documentation so that each QMI message and each TLV specifies
      in which libqmi version it was introduced, using "since:" tags in the QMI
      message databases.

Overview of changes in libqmi 1.16.0
----------------------------------------

* New `--enable-mbim-qmux' option during configure, which enables the support
  for using an MBIM control device as transport for the QMI messages, only if
  the MBIM device implements the "QMI service". This setting is automatically
  enabled if libmbim >= 1.14.0 is found in the system, and can be explicitly
  disabled with `--disable-mbim-qmux'.

* New request/responses:
  ** nas: new "Get LTE Cphy CA Info" request/response.
  ** nas: new "Force Network Search" request/response.

* qmi-network:
  ** Fixed several bashisms.

The following features which were backported to 1.14.x releases are also present
in libqmi 1.16.0:

* Added compatibility symbols for some API breaks introduced in 1.14.0:
  ** qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_get_current
     was renamed to qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_get_current_code.
  ** qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_get_new
     was renamed to qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_get_new_code.
  ** qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_set_current
     was renamed to qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_set_current_code.
  ** qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_set_new
     was renamed to qmi_message_dms_set_service_programming_code_input_set_new_code.
  ** QMI_NAS_SIM_REJECT_STATE_SIM_VAILABLE was renamed to
     QMI_NAS_SIM_REJECT_STATE_SIM_AVAILABLE.

* libqmi-glib:
  ** Fixed QMI_DMS_BAND_CAPABILITY_BC_15 enum value so that it isn't treated as
     a negative value.

* qmicli:
  ** Fixed --dms-get-band-capabilities output on 32-bit platforms.
  ** Fixed license text of the voice service implementation.


Overview of changes in libqmi 1.14.0
----------------------------------------

* This version comes with a couple of small API breaks:
  ** ECIO value type in "NAS Event Report Indication" is given as unsigned.
  ** ECIO value in ECIO List array type in "NAS Get Signal Strenght" is given as
     unsigned.
  ** QMI_NAS_SIM_REJECT_STATE_SIM_AVAILABLE enum name was fixed.

* The library and tools now support working with modems which only implement raw
  IP (i.e. no ethernet headers) in the WWAN interface. This relies on the kernel
  to expose '/sys/class/net/<WWAN>/qmi/raw_ip' sysfs files for each WWAN network
  interface (available since Linux 4.5-rc1).

* New initial support for the 'Voice' service.

* New request/responses:
  ** wms: new "Get Supported Messages" request/response.
  ** wds: new "Get Supported Messages" request/response.
  ** voice: new "Get Supported Messages" request/response.
  ** uim: new "Get Supported Messages" request/response.
  ** nas: new "Get Supported Messages" request/response.
  ** wda: new "Get Supported Messages" request/response.
  ** dms: new "Get Supported Messages" request/response.
  ** wds: new "Set Autoconnect Setting" request/response.
  ** wds: new "Get Autoconnect Setting" request/response.
  ** wds: new "Get PDN Throttle Info" request/response.
  ** uim: new "Change PIN" request/response.
  ** uim: new "Unblock PIN" request/response.
  ** uim: new "Verify PIN" request/response.
  ** uim: new "Set PIN protection" request/response.
  ** voice: new "Dial Call" request/response.
  ** voice: new "End Call" request/response.
  ** voice: new "Answer Call" request/response.
  ** voice: new "Get Config" request/response.
  ** voice: new "Get Supported Messages" request/response.

* New indications:
  ** wms: new "SMSC Address" indication.
  ** pds: new "GPS Ready" indication.
  ** wds: new "Packet Service Status" indication.

* New TLVs supported in existing messages:
  ** wds: support "UMTS Granted QoS" TLV in 'Get Current Settings'.
  ** nas: support "Home Network 3GPP MNC" in "Get Home Network" to know whether
     MNC is 2 or 3 digits.

* The qmicli tool has been updated with several new functionalities:
  ** New '--get-wwan-iface' command line option to allow querying which is the
     WWAN interface associated with a given /dev/cdc-wdm device.
  ** New '--wds-get-current-settings' command line option to query the current
     settings in the WDS service.
  ** New '--get-expected-data-format' and '--set-expected-data-format' actions
     to get or set the data format expected by the kernel.
  ** LTE band descriptions are now printed along with the EARFCN.
  ** Updated '--wds-start-network' arguments to allow specifying "key=value"
     pairs. The old legacy "[(APN),(PAP|CHAP|BOTH),(Username),(Password)]"
     format is kept as valid for backwards compatibility, although it should be
     assumed deprecated.
  ** Updated '--wds-start/stop-network' to allow autoconnect settings, and 3GPP
     or 3GPP2 profile parameters.

* The qmi-network helper script has been updated with several new features:
  ** Allow running with the qmi-proxy.
  ** Allow running qmi-network with multiple devices at the same time.
  ** Automatic link layer protocol update before connecting.
  ** Allow specifying APN user/password.

* Added command completion support in qmicli.

* Other bugfixes and minor improvements.

The following features which were backported to 1.12.x releases are also present
in libqmi 1.14.0:

* New request/responses:
  ** dms: new "Set FCC Authentication" request/response.


Overview of changes in libqmi 1.12.0
----------------------------------------

* New `--enable-qmi-username' option during configure, which allows specifying
  which will be the user owning the /dev/cdc-wdm character devices of all QMI
  modems (udev rules are installed to change file ownership). If this option is
  used, the qmi-proxy will only allow connections from processes running by the
  specified user or by the root user.

* New TLV builder and reader API, which is much more strict and secure. The
  autogenerated code will no longer first check if there is enough space
  available in the output message buffer and then write the parsed contents.
  Instead, the new reader API will be used, which is able to check for the
  expected size directly before writing in the buffer.

* New unit tests to check messages built by the libqmi-glib library, using a
  fake proxy. In order to support these, the QmiDevice has two new properties:
  ** "device-no-file-check": instructs the QmiDevice to avoid checking if the
     specified file exists.
  ** "device-proxy-path": specifies a custom abstract socket path for the
     QmiProxy, to avoid using the default one.

* New A-GPS support in the PDS service:
  ** pds: added "Get Default Tracking Session" request/response
  ** pds: added "Set Default Tracking Session" request/response
  ** pds: added "Get AGPS Config" request/response
  ** pds: added "Set AGPS Config" request/response

* Updated minumum available version of several messages:
  ** dms: "UIM Get IMSI" seems to be available in DMS 1.1 already
  ** dms: "UIM Get ICCID" seems to be available in DMS 1.1 already

* Other bugfixes and minor improvements:
  ** Attach timeout and idle events to the thread-default context.
  ** Fix bashisms in the qmi-network script.
  ** Fix qmi_message_set_transaction_id() in non-CTL messages.
  ** Fix segfault due to race condition in the QmiProxy.
  ** Fixed printing contents of structs with fixed sized strings in qmi-codegen.
