The simple-tester-c program makes use of the 'libqmi-glib' library.

The program will:
 * Open a connection to the qmi-proxy, or launch the qmi-proxy itself
   if it isn't already running.
 * Allocate a DMS client.
 * Query device capabilities.
 * Release DMS client.

The output will look like this:

$ ./simple-tester-c /dev/cdc-wdm0
max tx channel rate: 50000000
max rx channel rate: 100000000
data service:        non-simultaneous-cs-ps
sim:                 supported
networks:            gsm, umts, lte

Have fun!
